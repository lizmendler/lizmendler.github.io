       My name is Liz Mendler

      <p> 
         I am in pursuit of a masters degree in computer science currently taking some pre-requisites and learning how to code. I would like to use the skills I gain and the work I do to eventually work in animal conservation and animal biology as those are my passions. I hope to be able to improve conservation efforts with my work in the future. I am excited to have found my passion and each computer science class I take re-affirms this for me. I want to make a difference in the future. In the meantime, I enjoy video games such as Escape from Tarkov, Phasmophobia and R.E.P.O.
