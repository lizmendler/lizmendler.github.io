This GitHub account is my school account. I am currently taking Computer Science classes at Wake Technical Community College in an effort to fulfill the pre-requisites for masters programs I would like to apply to in Computer Science. I will be using this account to complete labs and other assignments throughout the course of my learning. I am excited to learn new skills and improve my existing ones. 

This repository will be used to hold my assignments and labs for my CTI 110 class - Web, Programming and Database Foundations.
