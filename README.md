This GitHub account is my school account. I am currently taking Computer Science classes at Wake Technical Community College in an effort to fulfill the pre-requisites for masters programs I would like to apply to in Computer Science. I will be using this account to complete labs and other assignments throughout the course of my learning. I am excited to learn new skills and improve my existing ones. 

This repository will be used to hold my assignments and labs for my CTI 110 class - Web, Programming and Database Foundations. 

# About Me

## My Interests

I enjoy playing video games, hiking, horse back riding and spending time with friends. My top 3 video games that I currently play with my friends include:

1. Escape from Tarkov
2. R.E.P.O
3. Phasmophobia

Academically, I am intrigued by the world of computers and coding. I enjoy seeing a product from the effort that I put into my work. It is important to me that the work that I put out into the world is representative of my efforts and skills. I am also passionate about continuously improving and want to eventually work my way into data engineering or data analysis for wildlife conservation.

## Websites I Recommend

If you are interested in something when you are bored and have no idea what to do. I would recommend the following websites:

* [The Bored Button](https://www.boredbutton.com) - I find this website to be interesting because of its randomness I never quite know what to expect. 
* [Little Alchemy 2](https://www.littlealchemy2.com) - I enjoy this website as well because of my need to do perfect completion I have spent a lot of time matching each of the different elements together until all elements have had their uses exhausted.
